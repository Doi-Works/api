# How to become a Doichain bounty hunter

Doichain LVC is setting up a bounty program in order to speed up the development of the Doichain ecosystem.
We will offer different kinds of bounties such es marketing, social media promotion, translation bounties.
In this document we want to focus on Doichain Development bounties.

We offer bounties depending on their priority normally in DOI (Doicoin). 
1 DOI is defined as 1 EUR as we defined in the whitepaper. In certain cases we offer bounties also in Fiat currency (€). 

## Requirements
In order to become a Doichain bounty hunter you should have experience as software developer and/or software tester.
Right now we mainly focus on developing our dApp which is written in Javascript using MeteorJS, NodeJS, ReactJS, MongoDB frameworks.
Doichain Node is a slightly modified fork of Namecoin (which is a early fork of Bitcoin Blockchain) so it would make sense you are alrady a experienced Bitcoin / altcoin blockchain developer or very good in C/C++ if you want to help here.
We have deficits in documentation, whitepaper accuracy and website contents. Also we have no English native speaker in our team yet. 

## How can I claim a bounty and how will I get paid later?
This works in x steps.
1. Go to https://bounties.doichain.org bounties are ordered by priority
2. Claim your bounty (after account creation)
3. Create a fork of the https://github.com/Doichain/dapp repository
4. Install the development environment (see: development-environment.txt)
5. Commit and push your work and create a pull request
6. If the pull request gets accepted we will send the amount to either your Doichain address which you provided with the pull request. (Fiat bounties can be paid in Bitcoin, USD, EUR). Please also provide an standard invoice to billing@doichain.org

### How to contact us
Sure, you can send us a message to development-team@doichain.org or contact us over our Telegram channel: https://t.me/doichain

### What is the value of DOI
As we mentioned in the whitepaper Doichain (DOI) is a utility token which must be used in order to store information on the Doichain blockchain. 
The price of storing a double-opt-in will be fixed in future. 
Storing one Double-Opt-In should cost 0,04 EUR (Fiat). Which means 1 DOI will be worth 1 €.

### Where can I sell my DOI
If you want to convert your DOI to another crypto currency you can sell it on the decentralized bitcoin exchange https://bisq.network/
