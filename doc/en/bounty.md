# How to become a Doichain bounty hunter
(please read what is a bounty programm here: https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-make-money-from-crypto-bounty-programs-the-complete-guide-aa78726d308d)

Doichain LVC is setting up a bounty program in order to speed up the development of the Doichain ecosystem.
We will offer different kinds of code and none-code bounties such as marketing, social media promotion and translation bounties.


In this document we want to focus on Doichain development bounties.
We offer bounties depending on their priority in DOI (Doicoin) but also in Fiat (€).
1 DOI is defined as 1 EUR as technically defined in the whitepaper.

## Requirements
In order to become a Doichain bounty hunter you should have experience as software developer and/or software tester.
Right now we focus on developing our dApp and which is written in Javascript using MeteorJS, NodeJS, ReactJS, MongoDB frameworks.
Doichain Node is a slightly modified fork of Namecoin (which is a early fork of the Bitcoin blockchain), so it would make sense, if you are already a experienced Bitcoin / altcoin / blockchain developer or good with in C/C++ if you want to help here.
We have deficits in documentation, whitepaper accuracy and website contents. Also we have no English native speaker in our team yet. 

## How can I block a bounty, how can I work on it and how will I get paid later?
This works in 6 steps.
1. Go to https://www.doichain.org/bounties - Bounties are ordered by priority
2. Block your bounty (after account creation)
3. Create a fork of the https://github.com/Doichain/dapp repository
4. Install the development environment (see: [Setting up a Doichain Development Environment ](dev-env.md) )
5. Commit and push your work and create a pull request
6. If the pull request gets accepted we will send the amount to either your Doichain address which you provided with the pull request. (Fiat bounties can be paid in Bitcoin, USD, EUR). Please also provide an standard invoice to billing@doichain.org

### How to contact us
Sure, you can send us a message to development-team@doichain.org or contact us over our Telegram channel: https://t.me/doichain

### What is the value of DOI
As we mentioned in the whitepaper Doichain (DOI) is a utility token which must be used in order to store information on the Doichain blockchain. 
The price of storing a double-opt-in will be fixed in future. 
Storing one Double-Opt-In should cost 0,04 EUR (Fiat). Which means 1 DOI will be worth 1 €.

### Where can I sell my DOI
If you want to convert your DOI to another crypto currency you can sell it on the decentralized bitcoin exchange https://bisq.network/
