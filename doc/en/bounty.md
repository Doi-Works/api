# How to become a Doichain bounty hunter
Please read what a bounty program is here: https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-make-money-from-crypto-bounty-programs-the-complete-guide-aa78726d308d

Doichain LVC is setting up a bounty program, in order to speed up the development of the Doichain ecosystem. We will offer different kinds of code and non-code bounties such as marketing, social media promotion and translation bounties.

We offer bounties depending on their priority in DOI (Doicoin) but also in Fiat (€). Both DOI (Doichain) and Fiat (€) bounties are exchangeable into Doichain LVC Shares (please read about Doichain LVC (Liechtenstein venture cooperative) on www.doichain.org).

In this document we focus on **Doichain code bounties**. If you are interested in **non-code bounties**, most parts of this document might not be interesting to you. In this case please jump straight to https://www.doichain.org/bounties and block any non-code bounty after account creation.

## Requirements
In order to become a Doichain bounty hunter, you should have experience as software developer and/or software tester. Right now we focus on developing our dApp, which is written in Javascript using MeteorJS, NodeJS, ReactJS and MongoDB. Doichain Node is a slightly modified fork of Namecoin (which is a early fork of the Bitcoin blockchain), so it would make sense, if you are already an experienced Bitcoin / altcoin / blockchain developer or good in C/C++, in case you want to help here. We have deficits in documentation, whitepaper integrity and website contents. We also don´t have a English native speaker in our team yet.

## How can I block a bounty, how can I work on it and how will I get paid later?
**This works in 6 steps.**
1. Go to https://www.doichain.org/bounties - Bounties are ordered by date and priority
2. Block your bounty (after account creation)
3. Create a fork of the https://github.com/Doichain/dapp repository
4. Install the development environment (see: Setting up a Doichain Development Environment)
5. Commit and push your work and create a pull request
6. If the pull request gets accepted we will send the amount to your Doichain address which you provided with the pull request. (Fiat bounties can be paid in Bitcoin, USD, EUR). Please also provide an standard invoice to billing@doichain.org.

## FAQ
- [If I need help or don't understand a detail in the Doichain code; can I contact you?](#how-to-contact-us)
- [What can I buy with DOI? Is it worth something?](#what-is-the-value-of-one-doi)
- [Where can I sell my DOI?](#where-can-i-sell-my-doi)

### How to contact us
Sure, you can send us a message to development-team@doichain.org or contact us over our Telegram channel: https://t.me/doichain

### What is the value of DOI
As we mentioned in the whitepaper, Doichain (DOI) is a utility token which is used in order to store information on the Doichain blockchain. The price of storing a double-opt-in will be fixed in future. Storing one Double-Opt-In should cost 0,04 EUR (Fiat), which means 1 DOI will be worth 1 €.

### Where can I sell my DOI
If you want to convert your DOI to another crypto currency, you can sell it on the decentralized bitcoin exchange application https://bisq.network/.
