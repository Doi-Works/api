This file is just a hint to a long forgotten/undocumented feature!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=

     The Tequila auto responder will detect automated email to your
     accounts, and thus not answer this kind of mail. However, some 
     of the mail servers out there don't care about setting up the
     appropriate header flags to mark their email as auto generated,
     which will trigger a vacation message by Tequila,naturally.

    If you want to disable the Tequila vacation response to such mail
    servers, please create/edit the file "~tequila/domains/novacation"
    with your favourite editor, and enter the machine names you'd like
    to blacklist. Simply enter one machine name per line ("grep" 
    regular expressions are allowed).
